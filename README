Project X
Authors: Denis and Abe

Welcome, this project is our implementation of the board game Chess. 
The rules are the same with the original game of chess however no En passant, pawn promotion or castling is implemented.
Players have a running profile that keeps a record of the player's stats. Users may also look at the rules and adjust 
the timer each player has before they lose a turn.  

Rules:
    King - move one tile in every direction that is could not lead to his instant capture.
    Queen - move vertically / horizontally or diagonally
    Rook - move vertically / horizontally
    Bishop - move diagonally
    Knight - move in an L-shape with two in one direction and one in an adjacent direction
    Pawn - move two steps forward given that it is it's first move, capture diagonally,  
        Pawn maybe promoted to a higher ranked piece given it reaches the opponent's side

    Check - occurs when the king is threatened of being captured
    Game ends - when timer runs out the player that still has time wins OR when the player
        forces another player into checkmate leaving the king no available places to move to safety.
