Project X
Authors: Denis and Abe

Welcome, this project is our implementation of the board game Chess. 
The rules are the same with the user running the file and either, loads a new game
loads a previous game, or views the rules.

New Game:
    User is able to decide: 
    How much time should be on the timer for each player.
    Which color they would like to start.

Rules:
    Displays a image of the breakdown of the objectives and how the pieces move.
    King - move one tile in every direction that is could not lead to his instant capture.
    Queen - move vertically / horizontally or diagonally
    Rook - move vertically / horizontally
    Bishop - move diagonally
    Knight - move in an L-shape with two in one direction and one in an adjacent direction
    Pawn - move two steps forward given that it is it's first move, capture diagonally,  
        Pawn maybe promoted to a higher ranked piece given it reaches the opponent's side

    Check - occurs when the king is threatened of being captured
    Game ends - when timer runs out the player that still has time wins OR when the player
        forces another player into checkmate leaving the king no available places to move to safety.
