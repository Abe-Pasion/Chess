*** THE AUDIO FEATURE DOES NOT WORK UNLESS USED COMPILED DIRECTED BELOW ***
Welcome, this project is our implementation of the board game Chess. 
The rules are the same with the original game of chess however no En passant, pawn promotion or castling is implemented.
Players have a running profile that keeps a record of the player's stats. Users may also look at the rules and adjust 
the timer each player has before they lose a turn.  

Rules:
    King - move one tile in every direction that is could not lead to his instant capture.
    Queen - move vertically / horizontally or diagonally
    Rook - move vertically / horizontally
    Bishop - move diagonally
    Knight - move in an L-shape with two in one direction and one in an adjacent direction
    Pawn - move two steps forward given that it is it's first move, capture diagonally,  
        Pawn maybe promoted to a higher ranked piece given it reaches the opponent's side

    Check - occurs when the king is threatened of being captured
    Game ends - when timer runs out the player that still has time wins OR when the player
        forces another player into checkmate leaving the king no available places to move to safety.

How to use the interface:
    Click on the piece you want to move and there will be circles displaying possible moves. 
        Click on the corresponding spot you would like to place the piece.
    
Compiling:
    Should be good to go and just run the jar file but if it does not work,
    go into the project folder

    "javac -d ../bin chess/*.java pieces/*.java"
    (runs all the files in both chess and pieces folders and puts the class files in bin)

    then leave the src folder and go to the bin folder (cd bin) and run
    "cd .."
    "cd bin"
    "Java chess.Main"

Extra features:
    Timer - Allows users to set a timer for each move and losses a turn if a move was not made in time
    Music - Plays background music and celebration music upon winning; *** THE AUDIO FEATURE DOES NOT WORK UNLESS USED COMPILED DIRECTED ABOVE ***
    Player - Saves the player information: name, games played, and games won
